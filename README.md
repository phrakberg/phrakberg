### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is James and this is a place for me to start throwing some beginner coding stuff

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been a photographer, truck driver, landscaper, and a warehouse worker before I got into IT.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about AWS!  I currently have my AWS SA-A, SysOps-Associate, and I'm working on my Certified Developer Associate.
